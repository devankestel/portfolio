Devan's Portolio
Projects | Skills | Timeline | Contact

WARNING: This porfolio has a Salt-O-Meter level of Dead Sea. Proceed with ?.

1. I am told it is trendy to have a fancy portfolio with a nice photo and parallax scrolling. Please pardon my humble Rails App.

4. My name is Devan Kestel. I recently graduated from *The Iron Yard* in **Orlando, FL**. Before that, I was busy studying how paint dries for a living (*no, really*) and in my spare time I was hopped up on *CodeSchool*, *Codecademy*, and **General Assembly's Dash**. If you want to know about me and code in **The Early Days**, check out my *Timeline*. 

2. Peanuts Picture

3. This is what I would look like if I was a Peanuts cartoon character. (Actually this IS pretty close to what I look like IRL.)

5. If you don't care what projects I've done and are simply looking for my contact info, my real e-mail is:
  devan.kestel@gmail.com

7. And my fake phone number (goes to Google Voicemail box) is: 
  XXX.XXX.XXXX

6. And if you're curious about my social media, here are some links:

Some highlights of work I have done. The lowlights can be seen on *Github*, just look for the commits with salty descriptions.

Meta

You're lookin at it. This portfolio is a full-on CRUD app with admin built with Devise and interactivity provided by AngularJS. Take a behind the scenes tour of the admin system, if you fancy a gander at this portfolio's guts.
